      <div class="map-general">
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">African Digital Humanities</span> is characterized by a focus on
          building capacity and
          infrastructure for digital scholarship, and on promoting access to cultural materials and information
          for
          all. African Digital Humanities scholars have been instrumental in the development of digital archives
          and
          libraries focused on African culture and history, and in promoting collaboration and networking across
          the
          continent.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Archiving and Preservation:</span> This trend is significant due to
          the rich historical and cultural
          heritage across the African continent. Digital archiving and preservation efforts help protect these
          invaluable resources from physical degradation, political instability, or other threats. Moreover, they
          provide a way for a broader audience to access these historical and cultural artifacts.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Digitization of Indigenous Knowledge:</span> The move towards the
          digitization and preservation of indigenous
          knowledge is an important area in Africa, given the continent's cultural and linguistic diversity. By
          digitizing and preserving indigenous languages, stories, and cultural practices, researchers can help
          ensure that these aspects of cultural heritage are not lost, while making them accessible to a global
          audience.</p>

              vibrant and
              inclusive platform dedicated to advancing digital humanities across the African continent. Through
              its
              online platform and offline activities, the NDHA facilitates knowledge sharing, capacity building,
              and
              networking opportunities for individuals and institutions interested in the intersection of digital
              technologies and the humanities.</p>
            <p>The network actively promotes inclusivity and equitable access to
              digital humanities resources, amplifying underrepresented voices and perspectives to shape the
              future
              of African digital scholarship. While our DHVN map helps with the overview look of DH in the world,
              the map of NDHA especially helps organize and highlight Digital Humanities projects in Africa in a
              compelling and comprehensive way.</p>
